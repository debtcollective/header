# Notifications

This scope will expose the `Notifications` component that uses a given user object in order to fetch the user notifications and inject them in a normalised shape to its children. Besides, it also exposes a NotificationPanel in order to be a component to being able to display notifications as expected and perform actions on them

<PropsTable of={Notifications} />

## Basic usage

When a given user has _unread_ notifications, the component will inject notifications data categorised by messages and alerts

<Playground>
  <Notifications
    user={{ unread_notifications: 3 }}
    service={{ getNotifications: () => Promise.resolve(notifications) }}
  >
    {({ alerts, messages }) => (
      <div>
        <b>Alerts</b>
        <p>{JSON.stringify(alerts)}</p>
        <b>Messages</b>
        <p>{JSON.stringify(messages)}</p>
      </div>
    )}
  </Notifications>
</Playground>

## NotificationsPanel

<PropsTable of={NotificationsPanel} />

<Playground>
  <NotificationsPanel notifications={notifications} />
</Playground>
